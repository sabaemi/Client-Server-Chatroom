This is a python chat application with simple security requirements such as encryption and hashing, that has a server side which allows multiple clients to connect to it. Each client needs to log in to the account or if doesnâ€™t have one, needs to sign up using a unique username and a password. 
Clients can only message their friends which they added to their friend list before starting the chat. This app also supports conferences (chat groups) that clients can start them by inviting their friends and the attendees can leave the conference by entering a specific command.
To show the user communication and the use of this app, a sample file is given.
